//A game round
// You attack the first alien ship
// If the ship survives, it attacks you
// If you survive, you attack the ship again
// If it survives, it attacks you again ... etc
// If you destroy the ship, you have the option to attack the next ship or to retreat
// If you retreat, the game is over, perhaps leaving the game open for further developments or options
// You win the game if you destroy all of the aliens
// You lose the game if you are destroyed

// There are six alien ships.
// The aliens' weakness is that they are too logical and attack one at a time: they will wait to see the outcome of a battle before deploying another alien ship.
// Your strength is that you have the initiative and get to attack first. However, you do not have targeting lasers and can only attack the aliens in order.
// After you have destroyed a ship, you have the option to make a hasty retreat.
